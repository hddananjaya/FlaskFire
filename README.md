### Thing I know:
* I can use document snapchat feature to get changes in documents
* I can use socketIO to send,recive data between the server and the client. realtime.

### Current Status:
* One user can use the system realtime. But when more than one dosen't work due to `chat` variable

### ToDo
* Find a way to change session variables when within the `on_snapshot()` method.
